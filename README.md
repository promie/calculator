# Javascript Calculator
Free Code Camp Advanced Project.
This is probably one of the hardest and longest projects that I've encountered so far.
The most difficult part was to get the logic right for the to function like the real
calculator. The useful Javascript method called .eval() was used to do the calculation
within the array.

My mentor, Tony Johnson, has again helped me with both the structure and
cleanliness of the code. I came up with my own logic which took over a week to complete.
